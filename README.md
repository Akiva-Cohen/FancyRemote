A program to make the default flipper zero remote look and feel nicer.
/n It lets you choose any remote you have made in the default infrared app.
In order to make your own the buttons should be named
["Volume_up",
"Volume_down",
"Navigate_left",
"Navigate_up",
"Navigate_right",
"Navigate_down",
"Power"
"Confirm"] (without the quotation marks);
Most code is my own, but i started with a tutorial and learned how a lot of stuff could be done by looking at other code.
 In addition, the code in the extensions file was coppied from the official firmware and only slightly edited.
