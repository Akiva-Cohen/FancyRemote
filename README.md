A program to make the default flipper zero remote look and feel nicer.
/n It currently grabs buttons that the user created in a remote called Cable (file browser coming soon)
In order to make your own the buttons should be named
"Volume_up",
"Volume_down",
"Navigate_left",
"Navigate_up",
"Navigate_right",
"Navigate_down",
"Power", and
"Confirm" (without the quotation marks);
Most code is my own, but i started with a tutorial and learned how a lot of stuff could be done by looking at other code.
 In addition, the code in the extensions file was coppied from the official firmware and only slightly edited.
